to solve this challenge we simply need to look at the python file. 
telnetlib_example.py

we know that the socket is  socket.cryptohack.org 
and that we want to connect on port  11112. 
and we know we are looking to buy a flag.

look at line 30 of the file provided 
 request = {
    "buy": "clothes"
}
json_send(request)

response = json_recv()

print(response)


we need to change the "clothes" value to be flag as we a shopping for flags
flag = crypto{sh0pp1ng_f0r_fl4g5}
