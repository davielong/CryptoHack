for this we need to convert the given values.

[99, 114, 121, 112, 116, 111, 123, 65, 83, 67, 73, 73, 95, 112, 114, 49, 110, 116, 52, 98, 108, 51, 125]

this is the given ASCII string we need to convert it to plain text, 
knowing that there are 127 chars in the ASCII char set it is a simple conversion 

Flag = crypto{ASCII_pr1nt4bl3}
